# 🎨 Hexifier &nbsp;![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-18.x-61dafb?logo=react) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

_A lightweight React playground that **instantly converts CSS color names to HEX** and shows the result in a live preview box._

---

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time preview** – the box background updates as you type  
- **Name → HEX conversion** using the ultra-tiny [`colornames`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colornames) helper  
- **Graceful handling** of unknown names (box stays transparent, no crash)  
- **Responsive & accessible** UI with smooth transitions  
- Minimal footprint – only React + one 1 kB utility library
